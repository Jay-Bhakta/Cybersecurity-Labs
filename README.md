# Cybersecurity Labs

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Labs repository! This repository contains various lab exercises and projects that I've completed as part of my coursework in Cybersecurity and Information Systems at UTSA.

## Overview

Below is a overview of the labs included in this repository:

### Telecommunications and Networking Labs (IS3413)
- **Lab 01**: Performed binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary conversions. Helping me understand the fundamental concept of binary and decimal number systems.
- **Lab 02**: Gained famiality using Wireshark and I analyzed network traffic involving SMTP and HTTP protocols provided by my instructor. This exercise helped me understand how application layer protocols operate and how sensitive data can be captured and analyzed on a network.
- **Lab 04**: Practiced identifying and analyzing MAC addresses. Understanding MAC addresses and their formats helps with recognizing and troubleshooting networking issues, identifying devices on a network, and enhancing network security by associating devices with their manufacturers.
- **Lab 05**: Applied subnetting techniques to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable subnets; analyzed network traffic samples to understand how transport layer protocols like UDP and TCP operate; and examined the differences between connectionless protocols (UDP) and connection-oriented protocols (TCP).
- **Lab 06**: Developed an RFP for a network redesign, detailing the specifications and requirements needed to obtain competitive bids from vendors.
- **Lab 07**: Developed a network design recommendation for a family’s home setup, balancing both wired and wireless solutions.
- **Lab 08**: Configured VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and assigned IP addresses to users within those VLANs to effectively manage and segment network traffic for different departments or functions in a business environment.
- **Lab 09**: Analyzed MPLS and explored various aspects of VPN configurations, including types of VPNs (remote access, site-to-site, mobile VPN), authentication processes, and the use of VPNs over the public internet.
- **Lab 10**: Explored various tools and techniques to analyze and assess internet domains and IP addresses for security and communication purposes.
- **Lab 11**: Explored various encryption methods and cryptographic concepts related to securing information and communications.
- **Lab 12**: Used WhatsUpGold software to manage and analyze network performance, device status, bandwidth usage, and environmental conditions. Gained practical experience in network management and monitoring.

### Operating Systems Security Labs (IS3033)
- **Lab 01**: Explored the importance of managing and identifying running processes in a multitasking operating system, understanding CPU and memory usage for performance optimization, the role of the process scheduler, the significance of process management for cybersecurity, the basics of buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and how tools like GDB and security measures such as ASLR can be used to debug programs and prevent security breaches.
- **Lab 02**: Explored file permissions, inode numbers, symbolic and hard links, memory management, and the use of GDB for debugging, including addressing a memory leak in a C program.

### Programming I Labs (IS2053)
- **Lab 01**: Created a simple interactive pizza ordering tool that asks for the user's name, allows them to choose from three types of pizzas (Cheese, Pepperoni, or Supreme), tracks the number of pizzas ordered using an accumulator, and provides feedback based on the user's input, including handling invalid choices and offering the option to order another pizza.
- **Lab 02**: Created a script that reads a text file named Numbers_in_text.txt, extracts integers from the file, stores them in a list, sorts the list, and calculates the median value of the numbers, which is then printed.
- **Lab 03**: Implemented a simple port scanner that prompts the user to enter an IP address and the number of ports to scan, then checks each specified port to determine if it is open or closed, and reports the total time taken for the scan.

### Programming II Labs (IS2063)
- **PA1**: Created a stock cost calculator that allows investors to input details about their intended stock purchases, such as the number of shares, price per share, and whether the trade is online or broker-assisted. The program calculates the total stock cost, any applicable online fees or commissions, and displays the final costs for multiple stocks before thanking the user for using the tool.
- **PA2**: Collaborated with a group of 3 members to write a java porgram which calculated the cost of stock purchases for multiple investors. The main features of the program allow users to input stock purchase details, calculate the total cost of purchases including online fees or broker-assisted commissions, and generate a detailed cost report for each investor. Throughout the development process, my team utilized collaboration tools such as GroupMe, Discord, and Zoom to communicate and coordinate their work effectively. Each member contributed to various aspects of the program, from input handling and data validation to stock cost calculations and formatting the final output.
- **PA3**: Collaborated with a group of 3 members to write a stock cost calculator program with two main classes: StockCost and StockCostCalculator.

### Unlocking Cyber Labs (IS1003)
- **Lab 00**: Completed several tasks: signed up for Slack, ensured I could use Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat, practiced taking and captioning screenshots with the Snipping Tool and Microsoft Word, reported my computer system information, and navigated various websites such as Blackboard, Slack, and Adobe Creative Cloud using a search engine.
- **Lab 01**: Learned how to set up and use a virtual machine (VM) using VirtualBox. The lab emphasized the importance of VMs for cybersecurity professionals, highlighting their benefits for security, experimentation, flexibility, cloning, and efficiency. I practiced installing VirtualBox and setting up a guest machine, gaining skills essential for testing software and conducting security operations in a controlled environment.
- **Lab 02**: Set up GitHub on my virtual machine, which is a version control system for tracking changes and coordinating work in software development. I also performed basic operations on GitHub to become familiar with the system.
- **Lab 04**: Set up and used a more secure browser and search engine. Conducted searches on my interests using Google hacking and generative AI techniques. Additionally, I experimented with faking an identity and detecting deep fakes. Finally, I filtered publicly available websites from Slack.
